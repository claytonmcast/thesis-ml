To build WASM use the following command: wasm-pack build --target web # Note that you might need to install extra libs in your system

The location of the apps which each folder has the name of language used
linear-regression/app
neural-network/app
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run website
python server.py

After each button stops executing, it will ask you to save a file, depending which button was clicked the file has to be saved in a location

Linear Regression:
Linear Regression Tensorflow.js cpu: linear-regression/training_result/tensorflow_js_cpu
Linear Regression Tensorflow.js webgpu: linear-regression/training_result/tensorflow_js_webgpu
Linear Regression WASM CPU: linear-regression/training_result/rust_wasm

Neural Network:
NN Tensorflow.js CPU: neural-network/training_result/tensorflow_js_cpu
NN Tensorflow.js WebGPU: neural-network/training_result/tensorflow_js_webgpu
NN WASM CPU: neural-network/training_result/rust_wasm

To run python app

Linear Regression:

cd to linear-regression/app/python
python main.py 1 # for sample 10%
python main.py 2 # for sample 50%
python main.py 3 # for sample 100%

When the process stop execution it will save the file automatically at linear-regression/training_result/python

Neural Network:
cd to neural-network/app/python
-- first extract neural-network/datasets/mnist_train_images.rar
python main.py 1 # for sample 10%
python main.py 2 # for sample 50%
python main.py 3 # for sample 100%

When the process stop execution it will save the file automatically at neural-network/training_result/python

To plot graphs

Linear Regression:

cd linear-regression/plot
python main.py

Neural Network:

cd neural-network/plot
python main.py
